This capstone project focuses on predicting housing prices using linear regression analysis on the Ames housing dataset. The goal is to explore the relationship between independent variables—such as above-ground living area (Gr_Liv_Area) and garage size (Garage_Area)—and the median house value. The project follows a structured data science workflow: first, the dataset (ames.csv) is loaded into a Jupyter Notebook (Linear_Regression_Ames.ipynb), cleaned, and preprocessed. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to visualize trends and relationships between key variables. The data is then split into training (75%) and test (25%) sets, and a multiple linear regression model is trained. Key parameters such as the intercept and coefficients are extracted, and predictions are generated for the test set. Model performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), while an error plot helps visualize discrepancies between predicted and actual values. The project concludes with an interpretation of coefficients, insights from the analysis, and potential improvements, showcasing key machine learning concepts such as data preprocessing, regression modeling, and performance evaluation in a real-world scenario.
